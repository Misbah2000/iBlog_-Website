            <p>While ministering over the years to people from all walks of life, I’ve come to believe there are very few atheists.iBlog is the most populer in younger and older children. One's you come you won't be regreted there.Come and enjoy bloging and explore Blogs. Sometimes it’s beautiful stained glass.</p>
            <p> What I’ve found is, most of the world believes in a higher power or a spiritual being of some sort. Perhaps it’s the god of their Catholic grandmother who seemed distant and angry, yet tethered them to the family through holiday gatherings, marriages, weddings, baptisms, funerals and good food. Perhaps some are more animistic in their belief, looking to a faith in many spiritual influences. Others, raised with a cultural belief in American Evangelicalism, might call themselves atheist, yet when pressed still believe in a higher power, albeit untouchable to them. For most in this world, there is a Spiritual Consciousness, even a distant hope, that there is a good source of light out there in the darkness. However, while most of humanity believes in a higher power of some sort, the majority, including those with a Christian background, aren’t sure this higher being can be trusted as a loving Power.</p>
            <p>The road of life seems to be pathed with glass. Sometimes it’s beautiful stained glass. Tales of kindness peek through like sunlight, illuminating our path with shades of green and yellow and magenta. Other times it seems we walk along sharp and broken pieces of pain. It’s here, among the broken shards, the belief in the God of the Bible is most challenged.</p>
            <p>If the god of the people you are ministering to is their pronoun preference, use it. Use it to teach them about this God who is an “us.”  Identity is such a huge topic in the world today. For the first time in the history of Language, we can explain a single God who identifies as an “us,” simply because we have single persons now referring to themselves in the plural pronoun. Isn’t God good? God knew we’d be here in this time of history. Be creative, use language to teach God’s Identity. Until people know God’s identity, theirs will not be clearly defined.</p>
